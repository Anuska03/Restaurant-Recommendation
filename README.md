# Restaurant-Recommendation
The Restaurant Recommendation System analyzes restaurant data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), predicts restaurant ratings, recommends restaurants, and identifies patterns within the industry. This project uses machine learning and data analysis to provide insights and actionable recommendations. 

Features:

Data Analysis and EDA

Explore and visualize data to understand distribution, trends, and patterns. This step involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, followed by various statistical and graphical analyses to identify key features and relationships.

Predict Restaurant Ratings

Train machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings based on features like cuisine, location, and price range. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, selecting appropriate algorithms, and evaluating model performance.

Recommend Restaurants

Develop a recommendation system to suggest restaurants based on user preferences and historical data. This can be achieved using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods to personalize recommendations.

Pattern Analysis

Analyze patterns related to restaurant locations, cuisine popularity, and rating distributions to uncover insights. This includes identifying trends such as the concentration of highly rated restaurants in certain areas or the popularity of specific cuisines over time.

Geographical Visualization

Plot restaurant locations on a map to visualize their geographical distribution. This helps in understanding the spatial patterns and identifying potential areas with high restaurant density or underserved regions.

City-wise Analysis

Group restaurants by city to analyze concentrations, average ratings, and popular cuisines. This involves aggregating data at the city level and performing comparative analyses to identify top-performing cities and local preferences.

Cuisine Popularity

Identify the most popular cuisines globally and within specific cities. This includes counting the frequency of different cuisines and normalizing these counts by factors like city population or number of restaurants to provide a balanced view.

Usage
EDA: Run the EDA notebook to explore and visualize the data.
Train the Model: Use the model training notebook to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting restaurant ratings.
Generate Recommendations: Implement the recommendation system using the provided scripts and notebooks.
Visualize Data: Utilize the visualization scripts to create geographical distribution maps and analyze cuisine popularity.
